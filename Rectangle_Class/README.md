# Rectangle Class

This Python class, `Rectangle`, represents rectangles and provides methods to calculate their area, perimeter, and check if they are squares.

## Class Attributes

- `length`: A positive float representing the length of the rectangle.
- `width`: A positive float representing the width of the rectangle.

## Class Methods

#### `__init__(self, length, width)`

Initialize a rectangle with a given `length` and `width`.

#### `get_area(self)`

Calculate and return the area of the rectangle (length * width).

#### `get_perimeter(self)`

Calculate and return the perimeter of the rectangle (2 * length + 2 * width).

#### `is_square(self)`

Check if the rectangle is a square. Returns `True` if it's a square (length equals width), and `False` otherwise.
